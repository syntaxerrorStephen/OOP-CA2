## Questions

### Question 1 â€“ Goods Containers (Interface) [6 marks]  Status: ðŸš«
Implement classes representing containers (Box, Cylinder, Pyramid) to store goods, using an `IMeasurableContainer` interface. Develop a `ContainerManager` class to manage containers, calculate total weight, and rectangular volume, among other functionalities.

### Question 2 â€“ Car Parking (Stack) [6 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Create a program to model a LIFO stack for managing cars in a driveway, using integer identifiers for cars. Implement logic to temporarily move cars if the requested car isnâ€™t the last in.

### Question 3 â€“ Nested HTML Tags (Stack) [6 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Write a program to check whether HTML tags are properly nested. The program should handle simple tags and ignore `<br>` as it lacks a closing tag.

### Question 4 - Flood Fill (Stack, 2D Array) [10 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Simulate a flood fill algorithm on a 10x10 grid. Implement a `Cell` class to manage coordinates and use a stack to iteratively fill neighboring cells in sequence.

### Question 5 â€“ Java Identifier Count (Map) [6 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Develop a program that reads a Java source file, counts identifiers, and maps identifiers to lines in which they occur. Output identifiers sorted in ascending order along with their count and corresponding lines.

### Question 6 â€“ Airport Flights (Queue) [6 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Simulate an airport runway using two queues to manage takeoffs and landings, prioritizing landing planes. Provide commands to queue, take off, or land flights.

### Question 7 â€“ Stock Shares Tax Calculation (Queue) [10 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Implement a FIFO system to calculate gains on shares using the FIFO rule for tax calculation. Track stock purchases and sales with a queue-based approach.

### Question 8 â€“ Multi-Company Stock Shares Tax Calculation (Queue) [10 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Extend Question 7 to support multiple companies, tracking shares for each company using a `Map<String, Queue<Block>>`.

### Question 9 â€“ Arithmetic Expression Calculator (Stack) [10 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Implement a stack-based calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions, supporting `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses.

### Question 10 â€“ Backtracking through a Maze (Stack) [10 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Create a stack-based algorithm to find a path through a maze, starting from the entrance and attempting to reach the exit.

### Question 11 â€“ Shortest Distance to City (Map, TreeSet, PriorityQueue) [20 marks] Status: ðŸš«
Implement an algorithm to find the least expensive route between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. Cities and distances should be read from a file, and results should display the shortest distance from a starting city to each reachable destination.
